          Lauren is a Senior Ruby on Rails developer, currently bopping in or around Boston Massachusetts. She is open to remote development opportunities, and would love to connect if you have something that you think is a good fit.

          In her free time, Lauren enjoys sinking into a complicated video game or board game, baking, doing logic puzzles, and riding her bike.

          Unfortunately, at the time of pulling this brief bio together, she does not have any existing photos of her looking wistfully off the edge the frame, but watch this space in case that ever changes.
          In the interim, feel free to imagine something bashful.
