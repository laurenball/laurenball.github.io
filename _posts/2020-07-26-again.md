title: A Little Less Hyde
---

High level summary of what this theme required:
- Favoring `Gemfile` over `gemspec`
- Adding a projects collection to allow for the blog format stuff
- Moving configuration points out of `config.yml`
  - this is still a work in progress
- Cleaning up views, making them more DRY

Things still remaining
- views are still a mess
- blog formatting isn't really started
- the project pictures should either be fixed or replaced
- better about blurb
