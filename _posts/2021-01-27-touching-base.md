Where has the time gone?

In my [last post]({% post_url 2020-08-24-removing-bootstrap %}), I included the aspirational goal of making one of these posts monthly, maybe.
In fairness, I didn't really commit to it very convincingly even when there were no stakes and I was full of that fresh just-built-a-thing energy.

Anyway, in the time between now and then, there have been many general changes in my sphere, both from a development and personal standpoint.
I figured it would make sense to just write something down here even if there wasn't much interesting to say for the sake of getting things moving here.
I am, as always, afraid of disappointing my fanatic readership of 0.

So, quick highlights from the last few months:
- I figured out why [Steven](https://github.com/laurenball/Steven) abruptly stopped working! He queries users on a per-server basis, and that is something that requires
[special permissions](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html) as of October of last year. Fortunately, fixing this is very low stakes and won't require anything special unless
he suddenly becomes a hit overnight success. Unfortunately, this means that I had to look at the code and want to tear it all down and start from scratch, but I don't have the energy to look at
that right now, so he will remain as is.

- I have set up a new dev environment twice using my [dotfile repo](https://github.com/laurenball/dotfiles/) and I'm very pleased with how quickly I can get up and running on a new computer now.
I think the next step is to automate the actual installs required to make those dotfiles work, but because I don't normally do so much setup, I don't think I'll end up doing all that.

- I've updated my site with better contact information and added a readme to my Github profile. I'm slowly feeling around for potential job opporunities, and I'm not actually convinced that
either of these things will be helpful, but it was a good excuse to do something fun.

- I'm planning to start a [threejs course](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) (thanks, Garret!) sometime in the next week with no real goal other than to learn something new and maybe have a little fun.

I don't think that's an exhaustive list of "things," but it's a start. I have a number of ideas of things to build in my time away from work, but I'm stunted because I feel that I either need to rest
or use productive energy doing interview prep and resume updating. I'm sure it will work out one way or another.
