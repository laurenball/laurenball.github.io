Whenever someone mentions front-end development and my relationship to it, the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, nearby windows shatter, and the room temperature drops by 10 degrees.
I'm not sure why front-end development is so harrowing for me, and why, of all the things in my domain, that's The Thing that triggers impostor syndrome.

My last front-end heavy position was using AngularJS (no, no, not Angular 2+, the original one) in an application that was already somewhat established when I started working with that company,
and a lot of the application stack was lost on me as a newbie in ways that I'm only starting to piece together now, six years later, and very far removed from the project.

So, in an attempt to avoid that bizarrely emotional turmoil, I'm trying to use some of my time off to get a little more comfortable with front-end dev and modernize my framework knowledge.
React has, from my limited view, been the darling of the JS framework world for a while now, and *so* that is where I'm spending some time.

In a seemingly unrelated side-note, I have also recently begun my first ever Pokemon Nuzlocke Challenge, and it is going... fine. It's fine, totally fantastic and not in anyway emotionally or mentally taxing. It's fine.
Something that *is* giving me some trouble in an otherwise definitely-going-very-well-don't-worry-about-it run of this beloved children's game is keeping track of which Pokemon I have encountered and on which routes,
which is something that is fundamentally required of playing this particular bastardization of Pokemon.
